# Ghostbuster Cadet Evaluation
This is the proposed roadmap to demo required skills to join team Phantom:

## PHASE I - PB components
Using TS, Tailwind, and Jest, recreate the most popular LinkedIn phantom as individual components, creatings spec and stories files.

Didn't copy your classes deliberately to show that I understand how to use tailwind

#### Bonus:
- write quick docs

## PHASE II - Refactoring UI
Recreate the most popular LinkedIn phantom with a modified UI.
Include a new slide range component (will be used to communicate suggested limits).

To show that I can not only recreate, but also create something new with tailwind, and that I understand your product and how a user interacts with it.
Not to step on anyone's toes. This is only to show that I can think from the other perspective.

## PHASE III - Live case
Create a new phantom for scraping leboncoin using components from either phase.
Mock data fetch scenarios in tests. Deploy app.

To showcase a potential new use-case for the store - scraping leboncoin 
my understanding of backend

#### Bonus: 
- spin up a real TS + Node backend with scraping implementation
- setup cron tasks to schedule scraping

## PHASE IV - Cleanup
Wrap up the project by cleaning up all code, and completing some of the bonuses.
